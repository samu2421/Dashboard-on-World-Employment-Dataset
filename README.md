# World Employment Dataset Dashboard

## Overview
This project involves the cleaning, analysis, and visualization of a raw employment dataset to showcase global employment dynamics. The dataset is cleaned using Tableau Prep Builder and visualized in Tableau Desktop, with the goal of uncovering key insights into the world employment trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Tableau Prep Builder**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Tableau Desktop**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning (Tableau Prep Builder)**:  
   - Imported and cleaned the raw employment dataset.
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant data points.
   - Transformed and structured the data for visualization.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Conducted an initial analysis to understand key patterns, distributions, and outliers.
   - Performed aggregation, grouping, and filtering to summarize the data.

3. **Dashboard Creation (Tableau Desktop)**:  
   - Created an interactive dashboard to visualize global employment trends.
   - The dashboard includes various visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps for an intuitive understanding of employment dynamics across regions and industries.

## Key Insights
- Insights on employment rates by region, gender, age group, and industry.
- Visual representations of global trends in unemployment, employment growth, and other labor market indicators.
